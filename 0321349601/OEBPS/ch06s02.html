We’ve examined two policies for executing tasks using threads—execute tasks sequentially in a single thread, and execute each task in its own thread. Both have serious limitations: the sequential approach suffers from poor responsiveness and throughput, and the thread-per-task approach suffers from poor resource management.</p>
<p>In <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Building Blocks">Chapter 5</a>, we saw how to use <span class="emphasis"><em>bounded queues</em></span> to prevent an overloaded application from running out of memory. <span class="emphasis"><em>Thread pools</em></span> offer the same benefit for thread management, and <code class="literal">java.util.concurrent</code> provides a flexible thread pool implementation as part of the <code class="literal">Executor</code> framework. The primary abstraction for task execution in the Java class libraries is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> <code class="literal">Thread</code>, but <code class="literal">Executor</code>, shown in <a class="link" href="ch06s02.html#ch06list03" title="Example 6.3. Executor Interface.">Listing 6.3</a>.</p>

<p><code class="literal">Executor</code> may be a simple interface, but it forms the basis for a flexible and powerful framework for asynchronous task execution that supports a wide variety of task execution policies. It provides a standard means of decoupling <span class="emphasis"><em>task submission</em></span> from <span class="emphasis"><em>task execution</em></span>, describing tasks with <code class="literal">Runnable</code>. The <code class="literal">Executor</code> implementations also provide lifecycle support and hooks for adding statistics gathering, application management, and monitoring.</p>
<p><code class="literal">Executor</code> is based on the producer-consumer pattern, where activities that submit tasks are the producers (producing units of work to be done) and the threads that execute tasks are the consumers (consuming those units of work). <span class="emphasis"><em>Using an <code class="literal">Executor</code> is usually the easiest path to implementing a producer-consumer design in your application.</em></span></p>

<p>Building a web server with an <code class="literal">Executor</code> is easy. <code class="literal">TaskExecutionWebServer</code> in <a class="link" href="ch06s02.html#ch06list04" title="Example 6.4. Web Server Using a Thread Pool.">Listing 6.4</a> replaces the hard-coded thread creation with an <code class="literal">Executor</code>. In this case, we use one of the standard <code class="literal">Executor</code> implementations, a fixed-size thread pool with 100 threads.</p>
<p>In <code class="literal">TaskExecutionWebServer</code>, submission of the request-handling task is decoupled from its execution using an <code class="literal">Executor</code>, and its behavior can be changed merely by substituting a different <code class="literal">Executor</code> implementation. Changing <code class="literal">Executor</code> implementations or configuration is far less invasive than changing the way tasks are submitted; <code class="literal">Executor</code> configuration is generally a one-time event and can easily be exposed for deployment-time configuration, whereas task submission code tends to be strewn throughout the program and harder to expose.</p>

<p>Execution policies are a resource management tool, and the optimal policy depends on the available computing resources and your quality-of-service requirements. By limiting the number of concurrent tasks, you can ensure that the application does not fail due to resource exhaustion or suffer performance problems due to contention for scarce resources.<sup>[<a id="ch06fn03" href="#ftn.ch06fn03" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> Separating the specification of execution policy from task submission makes it practical to select an execution policy at deployment time that is matched to the available hardware.</p>

<div class="section" title="Thread Pools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec6"/>Thread Pools</h3></div></div></div>

<p>A thread pool, as its name suggests, manages a homogeneous pool of worker threads. A thread pool is tightly bound to a <span class="emphasis"><em>work queue</em></span> holding tasks waiting to be executed. Worker threads have a simple life: request the next task from the work queue, execute it, and go back to waiting for another task.</p>
<p><a id="iddle1733" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2267" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2268" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2269" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2297" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3572" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3573" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3628" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4009" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4799" class="indexterm"/>Executing tasks in pool threads has a number of advantages over the thread-per-task approach. Reusing an existing thread instead of creating a new one amortizes thread creation and teardown costs over multiple requests. As an added bonus, since the worker thread often already exists at the time the request arrives, the latency associated with thread creation does not delay task execution, thus improving responsiveness. By properly tuning the size of the thread pool, you can have enough threads to keep the processors busy while not having so many that your application runs out of memory or thrashes due to competition among threads for resources.</p>
<p>The class library provides a flexible thread pool implementation along with some useful predefined configurations. You can create a thread pool by calling one of the static factory methods in <code class="literal">Executors</code>:</p>
<p title="newFixedThreadPool."><b><span class="strong"><strong>newFixedThreadPool.</strong></span> </b>A fixed-size thread pool creates threads as tasks are submitted, up to the maximum pool size, and then attempts to keep the pool size constant (adding new threads if a thread dies due to an unexpected <code class="literal">Exception</code>).</p>
<p title="newCachedThreadPool."><b><span class="strong"><strong>newCachedThreadPool.</strong></span> </b>A cached thread pool has more flexibility to reap idle threads when the current size of the pool exceeds the demand for processing, and to add new threads when demand increases, but places no bounds on the size of the pool.</p>
<p title="newSingleThreadExecutor."><b><span class="strong"><strong>newSingleThreadExecutor.</strong></span> </b>A single-threaded executor creates a single worker thread to process tasks, replacing it if it dies unexpectedly. Tasks are guaranteed to be processed sequentially according to the order imposed by the task queue (FIFO, LIFO, priority order).<sup>[<a id="ch06fn04" href="#ftn.ch06fn04" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup></p>
<p title="newScheduledThreadPool."><b><span class="strong"><strong>newScheduledThreadPool.</strong></span> </b>A fixed-size thread pool that supports delayed and periodic task execution, similar to <code class="literal">Timer</code>. (See <a class="link" href="ch06s02.html#ch06lev2sec8" title="Delayed and Periodic Tasks">Section 6.2.5</a>.)</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">newFixedThreadPool</code> and <code class="literal">newCachedThreadPool</code> factories return instances of the general-purpose <code class="literal">ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, which can also be used directly to construct more specialized executors. We discuss thread pool configuration options in depth in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Applying Thread Pools">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p>The web server in <code class="literal">TaskExecutionWebServer</code> uses an <code class="literal">Executor</code> with a bounded pool of worker threads. Submitting a task with <code class="literal">execute</code> adds the task to the work queue, and the worker threads repeatedly dequeue tasks from the work queue and execute them.</p>
<p>Switching from a thread-per-task policy to a pool-based policy has a big effect on application stability: the web server will no longer fail under heavy load.<sup>[<a id="ch06fn05" href="#ftn.ch06fn05" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup> <a id="iddle2274" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2275" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2456" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2457" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2458" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2758" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2759" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2973" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2974" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3599" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3825" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3826" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3929" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4017" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4018" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4252" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4267" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4269" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4400" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4401" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4635" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4641" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4672" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4673" class="indexterm"/>It also degrades more gracefully, since it does not create thousands of threads that compete for limited CPU and memory resources. And using an <code class="literal">Executor</code> opens the door to all sorts of additional opportunities for tuning, management, monitoring, logging, error reporting, and other possibilities that would have been far more difficult to add without a task execution framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Executor Lifecycle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lev2sec7"/>Executor Lifecycle</h3></div></div></div>

<p>We’ve seen how to create an <code class="literal">Executor</code> but not how to shut one down. An <code class="literal">Executor</code> implementation is likely to create threads for processing tasks. But the JVM can’t exit until all the (nondaemon) threads have terminated, so failing to shut down an <code class="literal">Executor</code> could prevent the JVM from exiting.</p>
<p>Because an <code class="literal">Executor</code> processes tasks asynchronously, at any given time the state of previously submitted tasks is not immediately obvious. Some may have completed, some may be currently running, and others may be queued awaiting execution. In shutting down an application, there is a spectrum from graceful shutdown (finish what you’ve started but don’t accept any new work) to abrupt shutdown (turn off the power to the machine room), and various points in between. Since <code class="literal">Executor</code>s provide a service to applications, they should be able to be shut down as well, both gracefully and abruptly, and feed back information to the application about the status of tasks that were affected by the shutdown.</p>
<p>To address the issue of execution service lifecycle, the <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> interface extends <code class="literal">Executor</code>, adding a number of methods for lifecycle management (as well as some convenience methods for task submission). The lifecycle management methods of <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> are shown in <a class="link" href="ch06s02.html#ch06list07" title="Example 6.7. Lifecycle Methods in ExecutorService.">Listing 6.7</a>.</p>
<div class="example"><a id="ch06list07"/><p class="title"><b>Example 6.7. Lifecycle Methods in <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code>.</b></p><div class="example-contents">

<pre class="programlisting">public interface ExecutorService extends Executor {
    void shutdown();
    List&lt;Runnable&gt; shutdownNow();
    boolean isShutdown();
    boolean isTerminated();
    boolean awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException;
    //  ... <span class="emphasis"><em>additional convenience methods for task submission</em></span>
}
</pre>
</div></div><br class="example-break"/>
<p>The lifecycle implied by <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> has three states—<span class="emphasis"><em>running</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>shutting down</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>terminated</em></span>. <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code>s are initially created in the <span class="emphasis"><em>running</em></span> state. The <code class="literal">shutdown</code> method initiates a graceful shutdown: no new tasks are accepted but previously submitted tasks are allowed to complete—including those that have not yet begun execution. The <code class="literal">shutdownNow</code> method initiates an abrupt shutdown: it attempts to cancel outstanding tasks and does not start any tasks that are queued but not begun.</p>
<p>Tasks submitted to an <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> after it has been shut down are handled by the <span class="emphasis"><em>rejected execution handler</em></span> (see <a class="link" href="ch08s03.html#ch08lev2sec5" title="Saturation Policies">Section 8.3.3</a>), which might silently discard <a id="iddle2128" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3830" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4265" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4266" class="indexterm"/>the task or might cause <code class="literal">execute</code> to throw the unchecked <code class="literal">RejectedExecutionException</code>. Once all tasks have completed, the <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> transitions to the <span class="emphasis"><em>terminated</em></span> state. You can wait for an <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> to reach the terminated state with <code class="literal">awaitTermination</code>, or poll for whether it has yet terminated with <code class="literal">isTerminated</code>. It is common to follow <code class="literal">shutdown</code> immediately by <code class="literal">awaitTermination</code>, creating the effect of synchronously shutting down the <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code>.(<code class="literal">Executor</code> shutdown and task cancellation are covered in more detail in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Cancellation and Shutdown">Chapter 7</a>.)</p>

However, <code class="literal">Timer</code> has some drawbacks, and <code class="literal">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> should be thought of as its replacement.<sup>[<a id="ch06fn06" href="#ftn.ch06fn06" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> You can construct a <code class="literal">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> through its constructor or through the <code class="literal">newScheduledThreadPool</code> factory.</p>
<p>A <code class="literal">Timer</code> creates only a single thread for executing timer tasks. If a timer task takes too long to run, the timing accuracy of other <code class="literal">TimerTask</code>s can suffer. If a recurring <code class="literal">TimerTask</code> is scheduled to run every 10 ms and another <code class="literal">Timer-Task</code> takes 40 ms to run, the recurring task either (depending on whether it was scheduled at fixed rate or fixed delay) gets called four times in rapid succession after the long-running task completes, or “misses” four invocations completely. Scheduled thread pools address this limitation by letting you provide multiple threads for executing deferred and periodic tasks.</p>
<p>Another problem with <code class="literal">Timer</code> is that it behaves poorly if a <code class="literal">TimerTask</code> throws an unchecked exception. The <code class="literal">Timer</code> thread doesn’t catch the exception, so an unchecked exception thrown from a <code class="literal">TimerTask</code> terminates the timer thread. <code class="literal">Timer</code> also doesn’t resurrect the thread in this situation; instead, it erroneously assumes the entire <code class="literal">Timer</code> was cancelled. In this case, <code class="literal">TimerTask</code>s that are already scheduled but not yet executed are never run, and new tasks cannot be scheduled. (This problem, called “thread leakage” is described in <a class="link" href="ch07s03.html" title="Handling Abnormal Thread Termination">Section 7.3</a>, along with techniques for avoiding it.)</p>
<p><code class="literal">OutOfTime</code> in <a class="link" href="ch06s03.html#ch06list09" title="Example 6.9. Class Illustrating Confusing Timer Behavior.">Listing 6.9</a> illustrates how a <code class="literal">Timer</code> can become confused in this manner and, as confusion loves company, how the <code class="literal">Timer</code> shares its confusion with the next hapless caller that tries to submit a <code class="literal">TimerTask</code>. You might expect the program to run for six seconds and exit, but what actually happens is that it terminates after one second with an <code class="literal">IllegalStateException</code> whose message text is “Timer already cancelled”. <code class="literal">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> deals properly with ill-behaved tasks; there is little reason to use <code class="literal">Timer</code> in Java 5.0 or later.</p>
<p>If you need to build your own scheduling service, you may still be able to take advantage of the library by using a <code class="literal">DelayQueue</code>, a <code class="literal">BlockingQueue</code> implementation that provides the scheduling functionality of <code class="literal">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code>. A <code class="literal">DelayQueue</code> manages a collection of <code class="literal">Delayed</code> objects. A <code class="literal">Delayed</code> has a delay time associated with it: <code class="literal">DelayQueue</code> lets you <code class="literal">take</code> an element only if its delay has expired. Objects are returned from a <code class="literal">DelayQueue</code> ordered by the time associated with their delay.</p>

This can be addressed within the <code class="literal">Executor</code> framework by using a bounded work queue—see <a class="link" href="ch08s03.html#ch08lev2sec4" title="Managing Queued Tasks">Section 8.3.2</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch06fn06" href="#ch06fn06" class="para">6</a>] </sup><code class="literal">Timer</code> does have support for scheduling based on absolute, not relative time, so that tasks can be sensitive to changes in the system clock; <code class="literal">ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> supports only relative time.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
