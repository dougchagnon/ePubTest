<p>End-of-lifecycle issues for tasks, threads, services, and applications can add complexity to their design and implementation. Java does not provide a preemptive mechanism for cancelling activities or terminating threads. Instead, it provides a cooperative interruption mechanism that can be used to facilitate cancellation, but it is up to you to construct protocols for cancellation and use them consistently. Using <code class="literal">FutureTask</code> and the <code class="literal">Executor</code> framework simplifies building cancellable tasks and services.</p>
