<p>Exclusive locking is a <span class="emphasis"><em>pessimistic</em></span> technique—it assumes the worst (if you don’t lock your door, gremlins will come in and rearrange your stuff) and doesn’t proceed until you can guarantee, by acquiring the appropriate locks, that other threads will not interfere.</p>
<p>For fine-grained operations, there is an alternate approach that is often more efficient—the <span class="emphasis"><em>optimistic</em></span> approach, whereby you proceed with an update, hopeful that you can complete it without interference. This approach relies on <span class="emphasis"><em>collision detection</em></span> to determine if there has been interference from other parties during the update, in which case the operation fails and can be retried (or not). The optimistic approach is like the old saying, “It is easier to obtain forgiveness than permission”, where “easier” here means “more efficient”.</p>
<p>Processors designed for multiprocessor operation provide special instructions for managing concurrent access to shared variables. Early processors had atomic <span class="emphasis"><em>test-and-set</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>fetch-and-increment</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>swap</em></span> instructions sufficient for implementing mutexes that could in turn be used to implement more sophisticated concurrent objects. Today, nearly every modern processor has some form of atomic read-modify-write instruction, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>compare-and-swap</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>load-linked/store-conditional</em></span>. Operating systems and JVMs use these instructions to implement locks and concurrent data structures, but until Java 5.0 they had not been available directly to Java classes.</p>

<p>The approach taken by most processor architectures, including IA32 and Sparc, is to implement a <span class="emphasis"><em>compare-and-swap</em></span> (CAS) instruction. (Other processors, such as PowerPC, implement the same functionality with a pair of instructions: <span class="emphasis"><em>loadlinked</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>store-conditional</em></span>.) CAS has three operands—a memory location <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> on which to operate, the expected old value <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, and the newvalue <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>. CAS atomically updates <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> to the new value <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>, but only if the value in <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> matches the expected old value <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>; otherwise it does nothing. In either case, it returns the value currently in <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>. (The variant called compare-and-set instead returns whether the operation succeeded.) CAS means “I think <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> should have the value <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>; if it does, put <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> there, otherwise don’t change it but tell me I was wrong.” CAS is an optimistic technique—it proceeds with the update in the hope of success, and can detect failure if another thread has updated the variable since it was last examined. <code class="literal">SimulatedCAS</code> in <a class="link" href="ch15s02.html#ch15list01" title="Example 15.1. Simulated CAS Operation.">Listing 15.1</a> illustrates the semantics (but not the implementation or performance) of CAS.</p>
<p>When multiple threads attempt to update the same variable simultaneously using CAS, one wins and updates the variable’s value, and the rest lose. But the losers are not punished by suspension, as they could be if they failed to acquire a lock; instead, they are told that they didn’t win the race this time but <a id="iddle2178" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2377" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3307" class="indexterm"/>can try again. Because a thread that loses a CAS is not blocked, it can decide whether it wants to try again, take some other recovery action, or do nothing.<sup>[<a id="ch15fn03" href="#ftn.ch15fn03" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> This flexibility eliminates many of the liveness hazards associated with locking (though in unusual cases can introduce the risk of <span class="emphasis"><em>livelock</em></span>—see <a class="link" href="ch10s03.html#ch10lev2sec10" title="Livelock">Section 10.3.3</a>).</p>

<p>The typical pattern for using CAS is first to read the value <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> from <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span>, derive the new value <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> from <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>, and then use CAS to atomically change <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> from <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> so long as no other thread has changed <span class="emphasis"><em>V</em></span> to another value in the meantime. CAS addresses the problem of implementing atomic read-modify-write sequences without locking, because it can detect interference from other threads.</p>

<p><code class="literal">CasCounter</code> in <a class="link" href="ch15s02.html#ch15list02" title="Example 15.2. Nonblocking Counter Using CAS.">Listing 15.2</a> implements a thread-safe counter using CAS. The increment operation follows the canonical form—fetch the old value, transform it to the new value (adding one), and use CAS to set the new value. If the CAS fails, the operation is immediately retried. Retrying repeatedly is usually a reasonable strategy, although in cases of extreme contention it might be desirable to wait or back off before retrying to avoid livelock.</p>
<p><a id="iddle2095" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3515" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">CasCounter</code> does not block, though it may have to retry several<sup>[<a id="ch15fn04" href="#ftn.ch15fn04" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> times if other threads are updating the counter at the same time.

<p>At first glance, the CAS-based counter looks as if it should perform worse than a lock-based counter; it has more operations and a more complicated control flow, and depends on the seemingly complicated CAS operation. But in reality, CAS-based counters significantly outperform lock-based counters if there is even a small amount of contention, and often even if there is no contention. The fast path for uncontended lock acquisition typically requires at least one CAS plus other lock-related housekeeping, so more work is going on in the best case for a lock-based counter than in the normal case for the CAS-based counter. Since the CAS succeeds most of the time (assuming low to moderate contention), the hardware will correctly predict the branch implicit in the <code class="literal">while</code> loop, minimizing the overhead of the more complicated control logic.</p>
<p>The language syntax for locking may be compact, but the work done by the JVM and OS to manage locks is not. Locking entails traversing a relatively complicated code path in the JVM and may entail OS-level locking, thread suspension, and context switches. In the best case, locking requires at least one CAS, so using locks moves the CAS out of sight but doesn’t save any actual execution cost. On the other hand, executing a CAS from within the program involves no JVM code, system calls, or scheduling activity. What looks like a longer code path at the application level is in fact a much shorter code path when JVM and OS activity are <a id="iddle1139" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1143" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1169" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1322" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1602" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1603" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2332" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2333" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4105" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4106" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4552" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4553" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5042" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5043" class="indexterm"/>taken into account. The primary disadvantage of CAS is that it forces the caller to deal with contention (by retrying, backing off, or giving up), whereas locks deal with contention automatically by blocking until the lock is available.<sup>[<a id="ch15fn05" href="#ftn.ch15fn05" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup></p>
<p>CAS performance varies widely across processors. On a single-CPU system, a CAS typically takes on the order of a handful of clock cycles, since no synchronization across processors is necessary. As of this writing, the cost of an uncontended CAS on multiple CPU systems ranges from about ten to about 150 cycles; CAS performance is a rapidly moving target and varies not only across architectures but even across versions of the same processor. Competitive forces will likely result in continued CAS performance improvement over the next several years. A good rule of thumb is that the cost of the “fast path” for <span class="emphasis"><em>uncontended</em></span> lock acquisition and release on most processors is approximately twice the cost of a CAS.</p>

<p>So, how does Java code convince the processor to execute a CAS on its behalf? Prior to Java 5.0, there was no way to do this short of writing native code. In Java 5.0, low-level support was added to expose CAS operations on <code class="literal">int</code>, <code class="literal">long</code>, and object references, and the JVM compiles these into the most efficient means provided by the underlying hardware. On platforms supporting CAS, the runtime inlines them into the appropriate machine instruction(s); in the worst case, if a CAS-like instruction is not available the JVM uses a spin lock. This low-level JVMsupport is used by the atomic variable classes (<code class="literal">AtomicXxx</code> in <code class="literal">java.util.concurrent. atomic</code>) to provide an efficient CAS operation on numeric and reference types; these atomic variable classes are used, directly or indirectly, to implement most of the classes in <code class="literal">java.util.concurrent</code>.</p>
