<p>The other end-run around the need to synchronize is to use <span class="emphasis"><em>immutable</em></span> objects [EJ Item 13]. Nearly all the atomicity and visibility hazards we’ve described so far, such as seeing stale values, losing updates, or observing an object to be in an inconsistent state, have to do with the vagaries of multiple threads trying to access the same mutable state at the same time. If an object’s state cannot be modified, these risks and complexities simply go away.</p>
<p>An immutable object is one whose state cannot be changed after construction. Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; their invariants are established by the constructor, and if their state cannot be changed, these invariants always hold.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb06"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>Immutable objects are always thread-safe.</p>
</div>
<p>Immutable objects are <span class="emphasis"><em>simple</em></span>. They can only be in one state, which is carefully controlled by the constructor. One of the most difficult elements of program design is reasoning about the possible states of complex objects. Reasoning about the state of immutable objects, on the other hand, is trivial.</p>
<p>Immutable objects are also <span class="emphasis"><em>safer</em></span>. Passing a mutable object to untrusted code, or otherwise publishing it where untrusted code could find it, is dangerous—the untrusted code might modify its state, or, worse, retain a reference to it and modify its state later from another thread. On the other hand, immutable objects cannot be subverted in this manner by malicious or buggy code, so they are safe <a id="iddle2204" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2353" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2376" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2533" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2713" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4496" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4497" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5016" class="indexterm"/>to share and publish freely without the need to make defensive copies [EJ Item 24].</p>
<p>Neither the Java Language Specification nor the Java Memory Model formally defines immutability, but immutability is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> equivalent to simply declaring all fields of an object <code class="literal">final</code>. An object whose fields are all final may still be mutable, since final fields can hold references to mutable objects.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb07"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>An object is <span class="emphasis"><em>immutable</em></span> if:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Its state cannot be modifled after construction;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All its flelds are <code class="literal">final</code>;<sup>[<a id="ch03fn12" href="#ftn.ch03fn12" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup> and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It is <span class="emphasis"><em>properly constructed</em></span> (the <code class="literal">this</code> reference does not escape during construction).</p></li></ul></div>
</div>
<p>Immutable objects can still use mutable objects internally to manage their state, as illustrated by <code class="literal">ThreeStooges</code> in <a class="link" href="ch03s04.html#ch03list11" title="Example 3.11. Immutable Class Built Out of Mutable Underlying Objects.">Listing 3.11</a>. While the <code class="literal">Set</code> that stores the names is mutable, the design of <code class="literal">ThreeStooges</code> makes it impossible to modify that <code class="literal">Set</code> after construction. The <code class="literal">stooges</code> reference is <code class="literal">final</code>, so all object state is reached through a <code class="literal">final</code> field. The last requirement, proper construction, is easily met since the constructor does nothing that would cause the <code class="literal">this</code> reference to become accessible to code other than the constructor and its caller.</p>

        stooges.add("Larry");

<p class="continued">Because program state changes all the time, you might be tempted to think that immutable objects are of limited use, but this is not the case. There is a difference <a id="iddle1073" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1158" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1726" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1920" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1921" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2343" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2344" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2350" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2351" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2527" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2568" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2712" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2742" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3352" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3485" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3725" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3726" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3780" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3781" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4124" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5119" class="indexterm"/>between an <span class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span> being immutable and the <span class="emphasis"><em>reference</em></span> to it being immutable. Program state stored in immutable objects can still be updated by “replacing” immutable objects with a new instance holding new state; the next section offers an example of this technique.<sup>[<a id="ch03fn13" href="#ftn.ch03fn13" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup></p>
<div class="section" title="Final Fields"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lev2sec9"/>Final Fields</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The <code class="literal">final</code> keyword, a more limited version of the <code class="literal">const</code> mechanism from C++, supports the construction of immutable objects. Final fields can’t be modified (although the objects they refer to can be modified if they are mutable), but they also have special semantics under the Java Memory Model. It is the use of final fields that makes possible the guarantee of <span class="emphasis"><em>initialization safety</em></span> (see <a class="link" href="ch03s05.html#ch03lev2sec12" title="Immutable Objects and Initialization Safety">Section 3.5.2</a>) that lets immutable objects be freely accessed and shared without synchronization.</p>
<p>Even if an object is mutable, making some fields <code class="literal">final</code> can still simplify reasoning about its state, since limiting the mutability of an object restricts its set of possible states. An object that is “mostly immutable” but has one or two mutable state variables is still simpler than one that has many mutable variables. Declaring fields <code class="literal">final</code> also documents to maintainers that these fields are not expected to change.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb08"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>Just as it is a good practice to make all fields <code class="literal">private</code> unless they need greater visibility [EJ Item 12], it is a good practice to make all fields <code class="literal">final</code> unless they need to be mutable.</p>

<div class="section" title="Example: Using Volatile to Publish Immutable Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lev2sec10"/>Example: Using Volatile to Publish Immutable Objects</h3></div></div></div>

<p>In <code class="literal">UnsafeCachingFactorizer</code> on page <a class="link" href="ch02s03.html#ch02list05" title="Example 2.5. Servlet that Attempts to Cache its Last Result without Adequate Atomicity. Don’t Do this.">24</a>,we tried to use two <code class="literal">AtomicReference</code>s to store the last number and last factors, but this was not thread-safe because we could not fetch or update the two related values atomically. Using volatile variables for these values would not be thread-safe for the same reason. However, immutable objects can sometimes provide a weak form of atomicity.</p>
<p>The factoring servlet performs two operations that must be atomic: updating the cached result and conditionally fetching the cached factors if the cached number matches the requested number. Whenever a group of related data items must be acted on atomically, consider creating an immutable holder class for them, such as <code class="literal">OneValueCache</code><sup>[<a id="ch03fn14" href="#ftn.ch03fn14" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup> in <a class="link" href="ch03s04.html#ch03list12" title="Example 3.12. Immutable Holder for Caching a Number and its Factors.">Listing 3.12</a>.</p>
<p>Race conditions in accessing or updating multiple related variables can be eliminated by using an immutable object to hold all the variables. With a mutable <a id="iddle2149" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2851" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3061" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3062" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3732" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5108" class="indexterm"/>holder object, you would have to use locking to ensure atomicity; with an immutable one, once a thread acquires a reference to it, it need never worry about another thread modifying its state. If the variables are to be updated, a new holder object is created, but any threads working with the previous holder still see it in a consistent state.</p>
<div class="example"><a id="ch03list12"/><p class="title"><b>Example 3.12. Immutable Holder for Caching a Number and its Factors.</b></p><div class="example-contents">

<pre class="programlisting">@Immutable
class OneValueCache {
    private final BigInteger lastNumber;
    private final BigInteger[] lastFactors;

    public OneValueCache(BigInteger i,
                         BigInteger[] factors) {
        lastNumber  = i;

<p><code class="literal">VolatileCachedFactorizer</code> in <a class="link" href="ch03s05.html#ch03list13" title="Example 3.13. Caching the Last Result Using a Volatile Reference to an Immutable Holder Object.">Listing 3.13</a> uses a <code class="literal">OneValueCache</code> to store the cached number and factors. When a thread sets the volatile <code class="literal">cache</code> field to reference a new <code class="literal">OneValueCache</code>, the new cached data becomes immediately visible to other threads.</p>
<p>The cache-related operations cannot interfere with each other because <code class="literal">One-ValueCache</code> is immutable and the <code class="literal">cache</code> field is accessed only once in each of the relevant code paths. This combination of an immutable holder object for multiple state variables related by an invariant, and a volatile reference used to ensure its timely visibility, allows <code class="literal">VolatileCachedFactorizer</code> to be thread-safe even though it does no explicit locking.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch03fn12" href="#ch03fn12" class="para">12</a>] </sup>It is technically possible to have an immutable object without all fields being final—<code class="literal">String</code> is such a class—but this relies on delicate reasoning about benign data races that requires a deep understanding of the Java Memory Model.
