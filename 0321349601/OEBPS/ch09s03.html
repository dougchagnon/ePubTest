<p>If all tasks were short-running (and the application had no significant non-GUI portion), then the entire application could run within the event thread and you wouldn’t have to pay any attention to threads at all. However, sophisticated GUI applications may execute tasks that may take longer than the user is willing to wait, such as spell checking, background compilation, or fetching remote resources. These tasks must run in another thread so that the GUI remains responsive while they run.</p>
<p>Swing makes it easy to have a task run in the event thread, but (prior to Java 6) doesn’t provide any mechanism for helping GUI tasks execute code in other threads. But we don’t need Swing to help us here: we can create our own <code class="literal">Executor</code> for processing long-running tasks. A cached thread pool is a good choice for long-running tasks; only rarely do GUI applications initiate a large number of long-running tasks, so there is little risk of the pool growing without bound.</p>
<p>We start with a simple task that does not support cancellation or progress indication and that does not update the GUI on completion, and then add those features one by one. <a class="link" href="ch09s03.html#ch09list04" title="Example 9.4. Binding a Long-running Task to a Visual Component.">Listing 9.4</a> shows an action listener, bound to a visual component, that submits a long-running task to an <code class="literal">Executor</code>. Despite the two layers of inner classes, having a GUI task initiate a task in this manner is fairly straightforward: the UI action listener is called in the event thread and submits a <code class="literal">Runnable</code> to execute in the thread pool.</p>
<p>This example gets the long-running task out of the event thread in a “fire and forget” manner, which is probably not very useful. There is usually some sort of visual feedback when a long-running task completes. But you cannot access presentation objects from the background thread, so on completion the task must submit another task to run in the event thread to update the user interface.</p>

The action listener first dims the button and sets a label indicating that a computation is in progress, then submits a task to the background executor. When that task finishes, it queues another task to run in the event thread, which reenables the button and restores the label text.</p>
<div class="example"><a id="ch09list05"/><p class="title"><b>Example 9.5. Long-running Task with User Feedback.</b></p><div class="example-contents">

<pre class="programlisting">button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {

        label.setText("busy");
        backgroundExec.execute(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                try {
                    doBigComputation();

                    GuiExecutor.instance().execute(new Runnable() {

                            button.setEnabled(true);
                            label.setText("idle");
                        }

<p>The task triggered when the button is pressed is composed of three sequential subtasks whose execution alternates between the event thread and the background thread. The first subtask updates the user interface to show that a longrunning operation has begun and starts the second subtask in a background <a id="iddle1305" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2420" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2421" class="indexterm"/>thread. Upon completion, the second subtask queues the third subtask to run again in the event thread, which updates the user interface to reflect that the operation has completed. This sort of “thread hopping” is typical of handling long-running tasks in GUI applications.</p>
<div class="section" title="Cancellation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lev2sec3"/>Cancellation</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Any task that takes long enough to run in another thread probably also takes long enough that the user might want to cancel it. You could implement cancellation directly using thread interruption, but it is much easier to use <code class="literal">Future</code>, which was designed to manage cancellable tasks.</p>
<p>When you call <code class="literal">cancel</code> on a <code class="literal">Future</code> with <code class="literal">mayInterruptIfRunning</code> set to <code class="literal">true</code>, the <code class="literal">Future</code> implementation interrupts the thread that is executing the task if it is currently running. If your task is written to be responsive to interruption, it can return early if it is cancelled. <a class="link" href="ch09s03.html#ch09list06" title="Example 9.6. Cancelling a Long-running Task.">Listing 9.6</a> illustrates a task that polls the thread’s interrupted status and returns early on interruption.</p>

                           cleanUpPartialWork();
                           break;

<p>Because <code class="literal">runningTask</code> is confined to the event thread, no synchronization is required when setting or checking it, and the start button listener ensures that <a id="iddle1398" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1399" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1757" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2433" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2434" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2646" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2647" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3231" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3319" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3320" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3700" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4226" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4530" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4531" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4918" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4919" class="indexterm"/>only one background task is running at a time. However, it would be better to be notified when the task completes so that, for example, the cancel button could be disabled. We address this in the next section.</p>

<div class="section" title="Progress and Completion Indication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lev2sec4"/>Progress and Completion Indication</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Using a <code class="literal">Future</code> to represent a long-running task greatly simplified implementing cancellation. <code class="literal">FutureTask</code> also has a <code class="literal">done</code> hook that similarly facilitates completion notification. After the background <code class="literal">Callable</code> completes, <code class="literal">done</code> is called. By having <code class="literal">done</code> trigger a completion task in the event thread, we can construct a <code class="literal">BackgroundTask</code> class providing an <code class="literal">onCompletion</code> hook that is called in the event thread, as shown in <a class="link" href="ch09s04.html#ch09list07" title="Example 9.7. Background Task Class Supporting Cancellation, Completion Notification, and Progress Notification.">Listing 9.7</a>.</p>
<p><code class="literal">BackgroundTask</code> also supports progress indication. The <code class="literal">compute</code> method can call <code class="literal">setProgress</code>, indicating progress in numerical terms. This causes <code class="literal">onProgress</code> to be called from the event thread, which can update the user interface to indicate progress visually.</p>
<p>To implement a <code class="literal">BackgroundTask</code> you need only implement <code class="literal">compute</code>, which is called in the background thread. You also have the option of overriding <code class="literal">onCompletion</code> and <code class="literal">onProgress</code>, which are invoked in the event thread.</p>
<p>Basing <code class="literal">BackgroundTask</code> on <code class="literal">FutureTask</code> also simplifies cancellation. Rather than having to poll the thread’s interrupted status, <code class="literal">compute</code> can call <code class="literal">Future. is-Cancelled</code>. <a class="link" href="ch09s04.html#ch09list08" title="Example 9.8. Initiating a Long-running, Cancellable Task with BackgroundTask.">Listing 9.8</a> recasts the example from <a class="link" href="ch09s03.html#ch09list06" title="Example 9.6. Cancelling a Long-running Task.">Listing 9.6</a> using <code class="literal">Background-Task</code>.</p>

<p>We’ve built a simple framework using <code class="literal">FutureTask</code> and <code class="literal">Executor</code> to execute longrunning tasks in background threads without undermining the responsiveness of the GUI. These techniques can be applied to any single-threaded GUI framework, not just Swing. In Swing, many of the features developed here are provided by the <code class="literal">SwingWorker</code> class, including cancellation, completion notification, and progress indication. Various versions of <code class="literal">SwingWorker</code> have been published in <span class="emphasis"><em>The Swing Connection</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>The Java Tutorial</em></span>, and an updated version is included in Java 6.</p>
