<p>So far we have focused on ensuring that an object <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be published, such as when it is supposed to be confined to a thread or within another object. Of course, sometimes we <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to share objects across threads, and in this case we must do so safely. Unfortunately, simply storing a reference to an object into a public field, as in <a class="link" href="ch03s05.html#ch03list14" title="Example 3.14. Publishing an Object without Adequate Synchronization. Don’t Do this.">Listing 3.14</a>, is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> enough to publish that object safely.</p>

<div class="section" title="Immutable Objects and Initialization Safety"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lev2sec12"/>Immutable Objects and Initialization Safety</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Because immutable objects are so important, the JavaMemory Model offers a special guarantee of <span class="emphasis"><em>initialization safety</em></span> for sharing immutable objects. As we’ve seen, that an object reference becomes visible to another thread does not necessarily mean that the state of that object is visible to the consuming thread. In order to guarantee a consistent view of the object’s state, synchronization is needed.</p>
<p>Immutable objects, on the other hand, can be safely accessed <span class="emphasis"><em>even when synchronization is not used to publish the object reference</em></span>. For this guarantee of initialization safety to hold, all of the requirements for immutability must be met: unmodi-fiable state, all fields are <code class="literal">final</code>, and proper construction. (If <code class="literal">Holder</code> in <a class="link" href="ch03s05.html#ch03list15" title="Example 3.15. Class at Risk of Failure if Not Properly Published.">Listing 3.15</a> were immutable, <code class="literal">assertSanity</code> could not throw <code class="literal">AssertionError</code>, even if the <code class="literal">Holder</code> was not properly published.)</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb09"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Immutable</em></span> objects can be used safely by any thread without additional synchronization, even when synchronization is not used to publish them.</p>
</div>
<p>This guarantee extends to the values of all final fields of properly constructed objects; final fields can be safely accessed without additional synchronization. However, if final fields refer to mutable objects, synchronization is still required to access the state of the objects they refer to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Safe Publication Idioms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lev2sec13"/>Safe Publication Idioms</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Objects that are not immutable must be <span class="emphasis"><em>safely published</em></span>, which usually entails synchronization by both the publishing and the consuming thread. For the moment, let’s focus on ensuring that the consuming thread can see the object in its aspublished state; we’ll deal with visibility of modifications made after publication soon.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb10"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>To publish an object safely, both the reference to the object and the object’s state must be made visible to other threads at the same time. A properly constructed object can be safely published by:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Initializing an object reference from a static initializer;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Storing a reference to it into a <code class="literal">volatile</code> field or <code class="literal">AtomicReference</code>;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Storing a reference to it into a <code class="literal">final</code> field of a properly constructed object; or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Storing a reference to it into a field that is properly guarded by a lock.</p></li></ul></div>
</div>
<p>The internal synchronization in thread-safe collections means that placing an object in a thread-safe collection, such as a <code class="literal">Vector</code> or <code class="literal">synchronizedList</code>, fulfills the last of these requirements. If thread <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> places object <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> in a thread-safe collection and thread <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> subsequently retrieves it, <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> is guaranteed to see the state of <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> as <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> left it, even though the application code that hands <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> off in this manner has no <span class="emphasis"><em>explicit</em></span> synchronization. The thread-safe library collections offer the following safe publication guarantees, even if the Javadoc is less than clear on the subject:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Placing a key or value in a <code class="literal">Hashtable</code>, <code class="literal">synchronizedMap</code>, or <code class="literal">Concurrent-Map</code> safely publishes it to any thread that retrieves it from the <code class="literal">Map</code> (whether directly or via an iterator);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Placing an element in a <code class="literal">Vector</code>, <code class="literal">CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>, <code class="literal">CopyOnWrite-ArraySet</code>, <code class="literal">synchronizedList</code>, or <code class="literal">synchronizedSet</code> safely publishes it to any thread that retrieves it from the collection;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Placing an element on a <code class="literal">BlockingQueue</code> or a <code class="literal">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code> safely publishes it to any thread that retrieves it from the queue.</p></li></ul></div>
<p class="continued"><a id="iddle1785" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1786" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2240" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2426" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2530" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2531" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2708" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2888" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3348" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4437" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4438" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4439" class="indexterm"/>Other handoff mechanisms in the class library (such as <code class="literal">Future</code> and <code class="literal">Exchanger</code>) also constitute safe publication; we will identify these as providing safe publication as they are introduced.</p>
<p>Using a static initializer is often the easiest and safest way to publish objects that can be statically constructed:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="programlisting">public static Holder holder = new Holder(42);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="continued">Static initializers are executed by the JVM at class initialization time; because of internal synchronization in the JVM, this mechanism is guaranteed to safely publish any objects initialized in this way [JLS 12.4.2].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Effectively Immutable Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lev2sec14"/>Effectively Immutable Objects</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Safe publication is sufficient for other threads to safely access objects that are not going to be modified after publication without additional synchronization. The safe publication mechanisms all guarantee that the as-published state of an object is visible to all accessing threads as soon as the reference to it is visible, and if that state is not going to be changed again, this is sufficient to ensure that any access is safe.</p>
<p>Objects that are not technically immutable, but whose state will not be modified after publication, are called <span class="emphasis"><em>effectively immutable</em></span>. They do not need to meet the strict definition of immutability in <a class="link" href="ch03s04.html" title="Immutability">Section 3.4</a>; they merely need to be treated by the program as if they were immutable after they are published. Using effectively immutable objects can simplify development and improve performance by reducing the need for synchronization.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch03sb11"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>Safely published <span class="emphasis"><em>effectively immutable</em></span> objects can be used safely by any thread without additional synchronization.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, <code class="literal">Date</code> is mutable,<sup>[<a id="ch03fn17" href="#ftn.ch03fn17" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup> but if you use it as if it were immutable, you may be able to eliminate the locking that would otherwise be required when sharing a <code class="literal">Date</code> across threads. Suppose you want to maintain a <code class="literal">Map</code> storing the last login time of each user:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="programlisting">public Map&lt;String, Date&gt; lastLogin =
    Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap&lt;String, Date&gt;());
</pre>
</div>
<p class="continued">If the <code class="literal">Date</code> values are not modified after they are placed in the <code class="literal">Map</code>, then the synchronization in the <code class="literal">synchronizedMap</code> implementation is sufficient to publish the <code class="literal">Date</code> values safely, and no additional synchronization is needed when accessing them.</p>

Synchronization must be used not only to publish a mutable object, but also every time the object is accessed to ensure visibility of subsequent modifications.

<p>Whenever you acquire a reference to an object, you should know what you are allowed to do with it. Do you need to acquire a lock before using it? Are you allowed to modify its state, or only to read it? Many concurrency errors stem from failing to understand these “rules of engagement” for a shared object. When you publish an object, you should document how the object can be accessed.</p>
