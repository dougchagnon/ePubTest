We use locking to ensure thread safety, but indiscriminate use of locking can cause <span class="emphasis"><em>lock-ordering deadlocks</em></span>. Similarly, we use thread pools and semaphores to bound resource consumption, but failure to understand the activities being bounded can cause <span class="emphasis"><em>resource deadlocks</em></span>. Java applications do not recover from deadlock, so it is worthwhile to ensure that your design precludes the conditions that could cause it. This chapter explores some of the causes of liveness failures and what can be done to prevent them.</p>



<div class="section" title="Deadlock"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lev1sec1"/>Deadlock</h2></div></div></div>

<p>Deadlock is illustrated by the classic, if somewhat unsanitary, “dining philosophers” problem. Five philosophers go out for Chinese food and are seated at a circular table. There are five chopsticks (not five pairs), one placed between each pair of diners. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating. Each needs to acquire two chopsticks for long enough to eat, but can then put the chopsticks back and return to thinking. There are some chopstick-management algorithms that let everyone eat on a more or less timely basis (a hungry philosopher tries to grab both adjacent chopsticks, but if one is not available, puts down the one that is available and waits a minute or so before trying again), and some that can result in some or all of the philosophers dying of hunger (each philosopher immediately grabs the chopstick to his left and waits for the chopstick to his right to be available before putting down the left). The latter situation, where each has a resource needed by another and is waiting for a resource held by another, and will not release the one they hold until they acquire the one they don’t, illustrates deadlock.</p>
<p>When a thread holds a lock forever, other threads attempting to acquire that lock will block forever waiting. When thread <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> holds lock <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> and tries to acquire lock <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span>, but at the same time thread <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> holds <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span> and tries to acquire <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> threads will wait forever. This situation is the simplest case of deadlock (or <span class="emphasis"><em>deadly embrace</em></span>), where multiple threads wait forever due to a cyclic locking dependency. (Think of the threads as the nodes of a directed graph whose edges represent the relation <a id="iddle1556" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1557" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1780" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1781" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1810" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1811" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2515" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2552" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2915" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3124" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3125" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3405" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3406" class="indexterm"/>“Thread <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> is waiting for a resource held by thread <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>”. If this graph is cyclical, there is a deadlock.)</p>
<p>Database systems are designed to detect and recover from deadlock. A transaction may acquire many locks, and locks are held until the transaction commits. So it is quite possible, and in fact not uncommon, for two transactions to deadlock. Without intervention, they would wait forever (holding locks that are probably required by other transactions as well). But the database server is not going to let this happen. When it detects that a set of transactions is deadlocked (which it does by searching the <span class="emphasis"><em>is-waiting-for</em></span> graph for cycles), it picks a victim and aborts that transaction. This releases the locks held by the victim, allowing the other transactions to proceed. The application can then retry the aborted transaction, which may be able to complete now that any competing transactions have completed.</p>
<p>The JVM is not nearly as helpful in resolving deadlocks as database servers are. When a set of Java threads deadlock, that’s the end of the game—those threads are permanently out of commission. Depending on what those threads do, the application may stall completely, or a particular subsystem may stall, or performance may suffer. The only way to restore the application to health is to abort and restart it—and hope the same thing doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>Like many other concurrency hazards, deadlocks rarely manifest themselves immediately. The fact that a class has a potential deadlock doesn’t mean that it ever <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> deadlock, just that it can. When deadlocks do manifest themselves, it is often at the worst possible time—under heavy production load.</p>

<p>The deadlock in <code class="literal">LeftRightDeadlock</code> came about because the two threads attempted to acquire the same locks in a <span class="emphasis"><em>different order</em></span>. If they asked for the locks in the same order, there would be no cyclic locking dependency and therefore no deadlock. If you can guarantee that every thread that needs locks <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span> at the same time always acquires <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span> in the same order, there will be no deadlock.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch10sb01"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>A program will be free of lock-ordering deadlocks if all threads acquire the locks they need in a fixed global order.</p>
</div>
<p>Verifying consistent lock ordering requires a global analysis of your program’s locking behavior. It is not sufficient to inspect code paths that acquire multiple locks individually; both <code class="literal">leftRight</code> and <code class="literal">rightLeft</code> are “reasonable” ways to acquire the two locks, they are just not compatible. When it comes to locking, the left hand needs to know what the right hand is doing.</p>

Consider the harmless-looking code in <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list02" title="Example 10.2. Dynamic Lock-ordering Deadlock. Don’t Do this.">Listing 10.2</a> that transfers funds from one account to another.

<p>How can <code class="literal">transferMoney</code> deadlock? It may appear as if all the threads acquire their locks in the same order, but in fact the lock order depends on the order of arguments passed to <code class="literal">transferMoney</code>, and these in turn might depend on external inputs. Deadlock can occur if two threads call <code class="literal">transferMoney</code> at the same time, <a id="iddle2628" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2733" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2734" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3054" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4459" class="indexterm"/>one transferring from <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and the other doing the opposite:</p>

<p>Deadlocks like this one can be spotted the same way as in <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list01" title="Example 10.1. Simple Lock-ordering Deadlock. Don’t Do this.">Listing 10.1</a>—look for nested lock acquisitions. Since the order of arguments is out of our control, to fix the problem we must <span class="emphasis"><em>induce</em></span> an ordering on the locks and acquire them according to the induced ordering consistently throughout the application.</p>
<p>One way to induce an ordering on objects is to use <code class="literal">System.identityHashCode</code>, which returns the value that would be returned by <code class="literal">Object.hashCode</code>. <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list03" title="Example 10.3. Inducing a Lock Ordering to Avoid Deadlock.">Listing 10.3</a> shows a version of <code class="literal">transferMoney</code> that uses <code class="literal">System.identityHashCode</code> to induce a lock ordering. It involves a few extra lines of code, but eliminates the possibility of deadlock.</p>
<p>In the rare case that two objects have the same hash code, we must use an arbitrary means of ordering the lock acquisitions, and this reintroduces the possibility of deadlock. To prevent inconsistent lock ordering in this case, a third “tie breaking” lock is used. By acquiring the tie-breaking lock before acquiring either <code class="literal">Account</code> lock, we ensure that only one thread at a time performs the risky task of acquiring two locks in an arbitrary order, eliminating the possibility of deadlock (so long as this mechanism is used consistently). If hash collisions were common, this technique might become a concurrency bottleneck (just as having a single, program-wide lock would), but because hash collisions with <code class="literal">System.identityHashCode</code> are vanishingly infrequent, this technique provides that last bit of safety at little cost.</p>

<p>You may think we’re overstating the risk of deadlock because locks are usually held only briefly, but deadlocks are a serious problem in real systems. A production application may perform billions of lock acquire-release cycles per day.

<p>While no method <span class="emphasis"><em>explicitly</em></span> acquires two locks, callers of <code class="literal">setLocation</code> and <code class="literal">getImage</code> can acquire two locks just the same. If a thread calls <code class="literal">setLocation</code> in response to an update from a GPS receiver, it first updates the taxi’s location and then checks to see if it has reached its destination. If it has, it informs the dispatcher that it needs a new destination. Since both <code class="literal">setLocation</code> and <code class="literal">notifyAvailable</code> are <code class="literal">synchronized</code>, the thread calling <code class="literal">setLocation</code> acquires the <code class="literal">Taxi</code> lock and then the <code class="literal">Dispatcher</code> lock. Similarly, a thread calling <code class="literal">getImage</code> acquires the <code class="literal">Dispatcher</code> lock and then each <code class="literal">Taxi</code> lock (one at at time). Just as in <code class="literal">LeftRightDeadlock</code>, two locks are acquired by two threads in different orders, risking deadlock.</p>
<p>It was easy to spot the deadlock possibility in <code class="literal">LeftRightDeadlock</code> or <code class="literal">transferMoney</code> by looking for methods that acquire two locks. Spotting the deadlock possibility in <code class="literal">Taxi</code> and <code class="literal">Dispatcher</code> is a little harder: the warning sign is that an <span class="emphasis"><em>alien</em></span> method (defined on page 40) is being called while holding a lock.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch10sb02"/><p class="title"><b/></p>

<p>Calling a method with no locks held is called an <span class="emphasis"><em>open call</em></span> [CPJ 2.4.1.3], and classes that rely on open calls are more well-behaved and composable than classes that make calls with locks held. Using open calls to avoid deadlock is analogous to using encapsulation to provide thread safety: while one can certainly construct a thread-safe program without any encapsulation, the thread safety analysis of a program that makes effective use of encapsulation is far easier than that of one that does not.

<p><code class="literal">Taxi</code> and <code class="literal">Dispatcher</code> in <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list05" title="Example 10.5. Lock-ordering Deadlock Between Cooperating Objects. Don’t Do this.">Listing 10.5</a> can be easily refactored to use open calls and thus eliminate the deadlock risk. This involves shrinking the <code class="literal">synchronized</code> blocks to guard only operations that involve shared state, as in <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list06" title="Example 10.6. Using Open Calls to Avoiding Deadlock Between Cooperating Objects.">Listing 10.6</a>. Very often, the cause of problems like those in <a class="link" href="ch10.html#ch10list05" title="Example 10.5. Lock-ordering Deadlock Between Cooperating Objects. Don’t Do this.">Listing 10.5</a> is the use of <code class="literal">synchronized</code> methods instead of smaller <code class="literal">synchronized</code> blocks for reasons of compact syntax or simplicity rather than because the entire method must be guarded by a lock. (As a bonus, shrinking the <code class="literal">synchronized</code> block may also improve scalability as well; see <a class="link" href="ch11s04.html#ch11lev2sec8" title="Narrowing Lock Scope (“Get in, Get Out”)">Section 11.4.1</a> for advice on sizing <code class="literal">synchronized</code> blocks.)</p>
<div class="sidebar"><a id="ch10sb03"/><p class="title"><b/></p>
<p>Strive to use open calls throughout your program. Programs that rely on open calls are far easier to analyze for deadlock-freedom than those that allow calls to alien methods with locks held.</p>
</div>
<p>Restructuring a <code class="literal">synchronized</code> block to allow open calls can sometimes have undesirable consequences, since it takes an operation that was atomic and makes it not atomic. In many cases, the loss of atomicity is perfectly acceptable; there’s no reason that updating a taxi’s location and notifying the dispatcher that it is ready for a new destination need be an atomic operation. In other cases, the loss of atomicity is noticeable but the semantic changes are still acceptable. In the deadlock-prone version, <code class="literal">getImage</code> produces a complete snapshot of the fleet locations at that instant; in the refactored version, it fetches the location of each taxi at slightly different times.</p>
<p>In some cases, however, the loss of atomicity is a problem, and here you will have to use another technique to achieve atomicity. One such technique is to structure a concurrent object so that only one thread can execute the code path following the open call. For example, when shutting down a service, you may want to wait for in-progress operations to complete and then release resources used by the service. Holding the service lock while waiting for operations to complete is inherently deadlock-prone, but releasing the service lock before the service is shut down may let other threads start new operations. The solution is to hold the lock long enough to update the service state to “shutting down” so that other threads wanting to start new operations—including shutting down the service—see that the service is unavailable, and do not try. You can then wait for shutdown to complete, knowing that only the shutdown thread has access to the service state after the open call completes. Thus, rather than using locking to keep the other threads out of a critical section of code, this technique relies on constructing protocols so that other threads don’t try to get in.</p>

<p>Just as threads can deadlock when they are each waiting for a lock that the other holds and will not release, they can also deadlock when waiting for resources.</p>

Resource pools are usually implemented with semaphores (see <a class="link" href="ch05s05.html#ch05lev2sec12" title="Semaphores">Section 5.5.3</a>) to facilitate blocking when the pool is empty. If a task requires connections to both databases and the two resources are not always requested in the same order, thread <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> could be holding a connection to database <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span><sub>1</sub> while waiting for a connection to database <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span><sub>2</sub>, and thread <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> could be holding a connection to <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span><sub>2</sub> while waiting for a connection to <span class="emphasis"><em>D</em></span><sub>1</sub>. (The larger the pools are, the less likely this is to occur; if each pool has <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> connections, deadlock requires <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> sets of cyclically waiting threads and a lot of unlucky timing.)</p>
<p>Another form of resource-based deadlock is <span class="emphasis"><em>thread-starvation deadlock</em></span>. We saw an example of this hazard in <a class="link" href="ch08.html#ch08lev2sec1" title="Thread Starvation Deadlock">Section 8.1.1</a>, where a task that submits a task and waits for its result executes in a single-threaded <code class="literal">Executor</code>. In that case, the first task will wait forever, permanently stalling that task and all others waiting to execute in that <code class="literal">Executor</code>. Tasks that wait for the results of other tasks are the primary source of thread-starvation deadlock; bounded pools and interdependent tasks do not mix well.</p>
