<p>Many of the blocking classes in <code class="literal">java.util.concurrent</code>, such as <code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code>, <code class="literal">Semaphore</code>, <code class="literal">ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>, <code class="literal">CountDownLatch</code>, <code class="literal">SynchronousQueue</code>, and <code class="literal">FutureTask</code>, are built using AQS. Without getting too deeply into the details (the source code is part of the JDK download<sup>[<a id="ch14fn13" href="#ftn.ch14fn13" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>), let’s take a quick look at how each of these classes uses AQS.</p>
<div class="section" title="ReentrantLock"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lev2sec13"/>ReentrantLock</h3></div></div></div>

<p><code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code> supports only exclusive acquisition, so it implements <code class="literal">tryAcquire</code>, <code class="literal">tryRelease</code>, and <code class="literal">isHeldExclusively</code>; <code class="literal">tryAcquire</code> for the nonfair version is shown in <a class="link" href="ch14s06.html#ch14list15" title="Example 14.15. Tryacquire Implementation From Nonfair ReentrantLock.">Listing 14.15</a>. <code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code> uses the synchronization state to hold the lock acquisition count, and maintains an <code class="literal">owner</code> variable holding the identity of the owning thread that is modified only when the current thread has just acquired the lock or is just about to release it.<sup>[<a id="ch14fn14" href="#ftn.ch14fn14" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup> In <code class="literal">tryRelease</code>, it checks the <code class="literal">owner</code> field to ensure that the current thread owns the lock before allowing an <code class="literal">unlock</code> to proceed; in <code class="literal">tryAcquire</code>, it uses this field to differentiate between a reentrant acquisition and a contended acquisition attempt.</p>
<p>When a thread attempts to acquire a lock, <code class="literal">tryAcquire</code> first consults the lock state. If it is unheld, it tries to update the lock state to indicate that it is held. Because the state could have changed since it was first inspected a few instructions ago, <code class="literal">tryAcquire</code> uses <code class="literal">compareAndSetState</code> to attempt to atomically update the state to indicate that the lock is now held and confirm that the state has not changed since last observed. (See the description of <code class="literal">compareAndSet</code> in <a class="link" href="ch15s03.html" title="Atomic Variable Classes">Section 15.3</a>.) If the lock state indicates that it is already held, if the current thread is the <a id="iddle1698" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4137" class="indexterm"/>owner of the lock, the acquisition count is incremented; if the current thread is not the owner of the lock, the acquisition attempt fails.</p>
<div class="example"><a id="ch14list15"/><p class="title"><b>Example 14.15. <code class="literal">Tryacquire</code> Implementation From Nonfair <code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code>.</b></p><div class="example-contents">

<pre class="programlisting">protected boolean tryAcquire(int ignored) {
    final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
    int c = getState();
    if (c == 0) {
        if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
            owner = current;
            return true;
        }
    } else if (current == owner) {
        setState(c+1);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</pre>
</div></div><br class="example-break"/>
<p><code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code> also takes advantage of AQS’s built-in support for multiple condition variables and wait sets. <code class="literal">Lock.newCondition</code> returns a new instance of <code class="literal">ConditionObject</code>, an inner class of AQS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Semaphore and CountDownLatch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lev2sec14"/>Semaphore and CountDownLatch</h3></div></div></div>

<p><code class="literal">Semaphore</code> uses the AQS synchronization state to hold the count of permits currently available. The <code class="literal">tryAcquireShared</code> method (see <a class="link" href="ch14s06.html#ch14list16" title="Example 14.16. Tryacquireshared and Tryreleaseshared from Semaphore.">Listing 14.16</a>) first computes the number of permits remaining, and if there are not enough, returns a value indicating that the acquire failed. If sufficient permits appear to be left, it attempts to atomically reduce the permit count using <code class="literal">compareAndSetState</code>. If that succeeds (meaning that the permit count had not changed since it last looked), it returns a value indicating that the acquire succeeded. The return value also encodes whether <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> shared acquisition attempts might succeed, in which case other waiting threads will also be unblocked.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">while</code> loop terminates either when there are not enough permits or when <code class="literal">tryAcquireShared</code> can atomically update the permit count to reflect acquisition. While any given call to <code class="literal">compareAndSetState</code> may fail due to contention with another thread (see <a class="link" href="ch15s03.html" title="Atomic Variable Classes">Section 15.3</a>), causing it to retry, one of these two termination criteria will become true within a reasonable number of retries. Similarly, <code class="literal">tryReleaseShared</code> increases the permit count, potentially unblocking waiting threads, and retries until the update succeeds. The return value of <code class="literal">tryReleaseShared</code> indicates whether other threads might have been unblocked by the release.</p>
<p><code class="literal">CountDownLatch</code> uses AQS in a similar manner to <code class="literal">Semaphore</code>: the synchronization state holds the current count. The <code class="literal">countDown</code> method calls <code class="literal">release</code>, which causes the counter to be decremented and unblocks waiting threads if the counter <a id="iddle2431" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3818" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3819" class="indexterm"/>has reached zero; <code class="literal">await</code> calls <code class="literal">acquire</code>, which returns immediately if the counter has reached zero and otherwise blocks.</p>
<div class="example"><a id="ch14list16"/><p class="title"><b>Example 14.16. <code class="literal">Tryacquireshared</code> and <code class="literal">Tryreleaseshared</code> from <code class="literal">Semaphore</code>.</b></p><div class="example-contents">

<pre class="programlisting">protected int tryAcquireShared(int acquires) {
    while (true) {
        int available = getState();
        int remaining = available - acquires;
        if (remaining &lt; 0
                || compareAndSetState(available, remaining))
            return remaining;
    }
}

protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int releases) {
    while (true) {
        int p = getState();
        if (compareAndSetState(p, p + releases))
            return true;
    }

<div class="section" title="FutureTask"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lev2sec15"/>FutureTask</h3></div></div></div>

<p>At first glance, <code class="literal">FutureTask</code> doesn’t even look like a synchronizer. But <code class="literal">Future.get</code> has semantics that are very similar to that of a latch—if some event (the completion or cancellation of the task represented by the <code class="literal">FutureTask</code>) has occurred, then threads can proceed, otherwise they are queued until that event occurs.</p>
<p><code class="literal">FutureTask</code> uses the AQS synchronization state to hold the task status—running, completed, or cancelled. It also maintains additional state variables to hold the result of the computation or the exception it threw. It further maintains a reference to the thread that is running the computation (if it is currently in the running state), so that it can be interrupted if the task is cancelled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="ReentrantReadWriteLock"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14lev2sec16"/>ReentrantReadWriteLock</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The interface for <code class="literal">ReadWriteLock</code> suggests there are two locks—a reader lock and a writer lock—but in the AQS-based implementation of <code class="literal">ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>, a single AQS subclass manages both read and write locking. <code class="literal">ReentrantRead-WriteLock</code> uses 16 bits of the state for the write-lock count, and the other 16 bits for the read-lock count. Operations on the read lock use the shared acquire and release methods; operations on the write lock use the exclusive acquire and release methods.</p>
<p>Internally, AQS maintains a queue of waiting threads, keeping track of whether a thread has requested exclusive or shared access. In <code class="literal">ReentrantRead-WriteLock</code>, <a id="iddle3400" class="indexterm"/>when the lock becomes available, if the thread at the head of the queue was looking for write access it will get it, and if the thread at the head of the queue was looking for read access, all queued threads up to the first writer will get it.<sup>[<a id="ch14fn15" href="#ftn.ch14fn15" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch14fn13" href="#ch14fn13" class="para">13</a>] </sup>Or with fewer licensing restrictions at <code class="literal"><a class="ulink" href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest">http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest</a></code>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch14fn14" href="#ch14fn14" class="para">14</a>] </sup>Because the protected state-manipulation methods have the memory semantics of a volatile read or write and <code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code> is careful to read the <code class="literal">owner</code> field only after calling <code class="literal">getState</code> and write it only before calling <code class="literal">setState</code>, <code class="literal">ReentrantLock</code> can piggyback on the memory semantics of the synchronization state, and thus avoid further synchronization—see <a class="link" href="ch16.html#ch16lev2sec4" title="Piggybacking on Synchronization">Section 16.1.4</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.ch14fn15" href="#ch14fn15" class="para">15</a>] </sup>This mechanism does not permit the choice of a reader-preference or writer-preference policy, as some read-write lock implementations do. For that, either the AQS wait queue would need to be something other than a FIFO queue, or two queues would be needed. However, such a strict ordering policy is rarely needed in practice; if the nonfair version of <code class="literal">ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> does not offer acceptable liveness, the fair version usually provides satisfactory ordering and guarantees nonstarvation of readers and writers.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
