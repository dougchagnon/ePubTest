<p>Applications commonly create services that own threads, such as thread pools, and the lifetime of these services is usually longer than that of the method that creates them. If the application is to shut down gracefully, the threads owned by these services need to be terminated. Since there is no preemptive way to stop a thread, they must instead be persuaded to shut down on their own.</p>
<p>Sensible encapsulation practices dictate that you should not manipulate a thread—interrupt it, modify its priority, etc.—unless you own it. The thread API has no formal concept of thread ownership: a thread is represented with a <code class="literal">Thread</code> object that can be freely shared like any other object. However, it makes sense to think of a thread as having an owner, and this is usually the class that created the thread. So a thread pool owns its worker threads, and if those threads need to be interrupted, the thread pool should take care of it.</p>
<p>As with any other encapsulated object, thread ownership is not transitive: the application may own the service and the service may own the worker threads, but the application doesn’t own the worker threads and therefore should not attempt to stop them directly. Instead, the service should provide <span class="emphasis"><em>lifecycle methods</em></span> for shutting itself down that also shut down the owned threads; then the application can shut down the service, and the service can shut down the threads. <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> provides the <code class="literal">shutdown</code> and <code class="literal">shutdownNow</code> methods; other thread-owning services should provide a similar shutdown mechanism.</p>

<p>Provide lifecycle methods whenever a thread-owning service has a lifetime longer than that of the method that created it.</p>

<p>Most server applications use logging, which can be as simple as inserting <code class="literal">println</code> statements into the code. Stream classes like <code class="literal">PrintWriter</code> are thread-safe, so this simple approach would require no explicit synchronization.<sup>[<a id="ch07fn03" href="#ftn.ch07fn03" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> However, as <a id="iddle2094" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2183" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2438" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2134" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2921" class="indexterm"/>we’ll see in <a class="link" href="ch11s06.html" title="Reducing Context Switch Overhead">Section 11.6</a>, inline logging can have some performance costs in highvolume applications. Another alternative is have the <code class="literal">log</code> call queue the log message for processing by another thread.</p>

<p>For a service like <code class="literal">LogWriter</code> to be useful in production, we need a way to terminate the logger thread so it does not prevent the JVM from shutting down <a id="iddle1011" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1153" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1336" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2132" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2270" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2271" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2462" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2463" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3782" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3964" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3965" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4042" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4043" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4253" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4268" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4271" class="indexterm"/>normally. Stopping the logger thread is easy enough, since it repeatedly calls <code class="literal">take</code>, which is responsive to interruption; if the logger thread is modified to exit on catching <code class="literal">InterruptedException</code>, then interrupting the logger thread stops the service.</p>
<p>However, simply making the logger thread exit is not a very satisfying shutdown mechanism. Such an abrupt shutdown discards log messages that might be waiting to be written to the log, but, more importantly, threads blocked in <code class="literal">log</code> because the queue is full <span class="emphasis"><em>will never become unblocked</em></span>. Cancelling a producerconsumer activity requires cancelling both the producers and the consumers. Interrupting the logger thread deals with the consumer, but because the producers in this case are not dedicated threads, cancelling them is harder.</p>
<p>Another approach to shutting down <code class="literal">LogWriter</code> would be to set a “shutdown requested” flag to prevent further messages from being submitted, as shown in <a class="link" href="ch07s02.html#ch07list14" title="Example 7.14. Unreliable Way to Add Shutdown Support to the Logging Service.">Listing 7.14</a>. The consumer could then drain the queue upon being notified that shutdown has been requested, writing out any pending messages and unblocking any producers blocked in <code class="literal">log</code>. However, this approach has race conditions that make it unreliable. The implementation of <code class="literal">log</code> is a check-then-act sequence: producers could observe that the service has not yet been shut down but still queue messages after the shutdown, again with the risk that the producer might get blocked in <code class="literal">log</code> and never become unblocked. There are tricks that reduce the likelihood of this (like having the consumer wait several seconds before declaring the queue drained), but these do not change the fundamental problem, merely the likelihood that it will cause a failure.</p>

<p>The way to provide reliable shutdown for <code class="literal">LogWriter</code> is to fix the race condition, which means making the submission of a new log message atomic. But we don’t want to hold a lock while trying to enqueue the message, since <code class="literal">put</code> could block. Instead, we can atomically check for shutdown and conditionally increment a counter to “reserve” the right to submit a message, as shown in <code class="literal">LogService</code> in <a class="link" href="ch07s02.html#ch07list15" title="Example 7.15. Adding Reliable Cancellation to LogWriter.">Listing 7.15</a>.</p>

<p>However, there is no general way to find out which tasks started but did not complete. This means that there is no way of knowing the state of the tasks in progress at shutdown time unless the tasks themselves perform some sort of checkpointing. To know which tasks have not completed, you need to know not only which tasks didn’t start, but also which tasks were in progress when the executor was shut down.<sup>[<a id="ch07fn06" href="#ftn.ch07fn06" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup></p>

By encapsulating an <code class="literal">ExecutorService</code> and instrumenting <code class="literal">execute</code> (and similarly <code class="literal">submit</code>, not shown) to remember <a id="iddle2207" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5153" class="indexterm"/>which tasks were cancelled after shutdown, <code class="literal">TrackingExecutor</code> can identify which tasks started but did not complete normally. After the executor terminates, <code class="literal">getCancelledTasks</code> returns the list of cancelled tasks. In order for this technique to work, the tasks must preserve the thread’s interrupted status when they return, which well behaved tasks will do anyway.</p>

<p><code class="literal">WebCrawler</code> in <a class="link" href="ch07s02.html#ch07list22" title="Example 7.22. Using TrackingExecutorService to Save Unfinished Tasks for Later Execution.">Listing 7.22</a> shows an application of <code class="literal">TrackingExecutor</code>. The work of a web crawler is often unbounded, so if a crawler must be shut down we might want to save its state so it can be restarted later. <code class="literal">CrawlTask</code> provides a <code class="literal">getPage</code> method that identifies what page it is working on. When the crawler is shut down, both the tasks that did not start and those that were cancelled are scanned and their URLs recorded, so that page-crawling tasks for those URLs can be added to the queue when the crawler restarts.</p>
<p><code class="literal">TrackingExecutor</code> has an unavoidable race condition that could make it yield false positives: tasks that are identified as cancelled but actually completed.

This is not a problem if tasks are <span class="emphasis"><em>idempotent</em></span> (if performing them twice has the same effect as performing them once), as they typically are in a web crawler. Otherwise, the application retrieving the cancelled tasks must be aware of this risk and be prepared to deal with false positives.</p>
